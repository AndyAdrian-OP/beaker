# Glossary

Most terms used in Beaker documentation should be common. The following documents project jargon which may otherwise be confusing.

## Coordinator

The Coordinator is the system on which Beaker itself is run. In many environments this will be a local host, typically a developer's primary machine. Used instead of [Master](#master) to avoid confusion.

## System Under Test

A System Under Test (SUT) is one of the systems which is the subject of testing with Beaker. Contrast the [Beaker Coordinator](#coordinator).
